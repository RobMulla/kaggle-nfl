# Evaluation
Your challenge is to propose specific rule modifications (e.g. changes to the initial formation, tackling techniques, blocking etc.), supported by data, that may reduce the occurrence of concussions during punt plays.

A valid submission will include:

- Summary Slides: A summary of the proposed rule change presented in slide format and delivered as either a PDF or PPT file.
- Kernels Analysis: At least one kernel containing the analysis to support your proposal. All kernels submitted must be made public on or before the submission deadline to be eligible. If submitting as a team, all team members must be listed as collaborators on all kernels submitted.
Submissions will be judged by the NFL on the following criteria:

1. Solution Efficacy - Have you clearly demonstrated, through your data analysis, that you have an understanding of what play features may be associated with concussions and how your proposed rule change(s) will reduce these injuries? Your kernels should be easy to understand and the analysis should be reproducible.
2. Game Integrity - Is your proposal actionable by the NFL? Could they implement your rule change and still maintain the integrity of the game? Have you considered the way your proposed changes to game dynamics could introduce new risks to player safety? Strong submissions will demonstrate an understanding for the game overall.

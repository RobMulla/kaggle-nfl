# Submission Instructions
You will be able to make submissions starting December 14th. At that time, a submission form will be made available.

You can make as many submissions as you like, but we will only consider your latest submission before the deadline of January 9th.

If you are submitting as a team, all team members must be listed as collaborators on the submitted kernel, and all team members must accept the competition rules before the submission deadline.

A valid submission will include:

- Summary Slides: A summary of the proposed rule change presented in slide format and delivered as either a PDF or PPT file.
- Kernels Analysis: At least one kernel containing the analysis to support your proposal. All kernels submitted must be made public on or before the submission deadline to be eligible. If submitting as a team, all team members must be listed as collaborators on all kernels submitted.
